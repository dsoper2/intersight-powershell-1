## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**Size** | **Int64** | Number of identifiers this block can hold. | [optional] [readonly] 
**VarFrom** | **String** | Starting WWN identifier of the block must be in hexadecimal format xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx. Allowed ranges are 20:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 to 20:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF or from 50:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 to 5F:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. To ensure uniqueness of WWN&#39;s in the SAN fabric, you are strongly encouraged to use the following WWN prefix; 20:00:00:25:B5:xx:xx:xx. | [optional] 
**To** | **String** | Ending WWN identifier of the block must be in hexadecimal format xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx. | [optional]
