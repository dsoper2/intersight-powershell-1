# VnicFcInterruptSettings
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**Mode** | **String** | The preferred driver interrupt mode. This can be one of the following:- MSIx — Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) with the optional extension. MSI   — MSI only. INTx  — PCI INTx interrupts. MSIx is the recommended option. | [optional] [default to "MSIx"]
